# Oursky Developer Pre-Test 2021

Thank you for applying to Oursky. When considering applicants for developer positions, we emphasize on their true
technical skills, which can't be measured by their CV alone. That's why we hope you would take time to complete this
pre-test.

Please do not disclose the content of this test to others.

For the answers, please pick a programming language you're familiar with.

To answer the questions, please create a gist link at gist.github.com, with 3 files named answer[1-3].md (or the correct
extension for the programming language, e.g. answer1.c / answer2.md / answer3.py), and reply our pre-test interview
email with the gist link. The gist link is expect to be configured with non-searchable. Also, please donâ€™t send Github
repo or zip file to us.

All 3 questions are mandatory.

Your answer will be evaluated based on:
* Correctness of your solutions
* Cleanness of your code
* Expressiveness and Clarity of your logic.
