# Question 1

Write a function that takes two arrays as input, each array contains a list of A-Z; Your program should return True if the
2nd array is a subset of 1st array, or False if not.

For example:
* isSubset([A,B,C,D,E], [A,E,D]) = true
* isSubset([A,B,C,D,E], [A,D,Z]) = false
* isSubset([A,D,E], [A,A,D,E]) = true

Please explain the computational complexity of your answer in Big-O notation, i.e. O(log n) or O(n ^2)?
